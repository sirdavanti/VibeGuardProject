Current escrow solutions are either too slow (human-led) or too rigid (code-only).VibeGuard is the middle ground. It is an AI-First Autonomous Arbiter that doesn't just check if a file was sent—it understands if the work actually matches the "vibe" and quality of the contract terms.🌟 Key FeaturesAutonomous Arbitration: Powered by Gemini 3 Flash to judge qualitative work (code, design, writing).On-chain Certainty: Direct integration with BNB Smart Chain for fund locking and release.Vibe-First UI: A professional interface designed with a Muted Off-White base, Royal Blue accents for trust, and Coral highlights for action.Instant Settlement: No more 5-day waiting periods for human dispute resolution.🛠️ Tech StackComponentTechnologyAI EngineGoogle AI Studio (Gemini 3 Flash)BlockchainBNB Smart Chain / opBNBFrameworkStreamlit (Python)Web3 InterfaceWeb3.pyTypographySpace Grotesk / Inter🔗 On-chain ProofTo satisfy the OpenClaw submission requirements, the following transaction demonstrates the autonomous release of funds following a successful AI Vibe-Check:Network: BNB Smart Chain (Testnet)Transaction Hash: PASTE_YOUR_TX_HASH_HEREStatus: Verified & Reproducible🧠 AI Build Log (Bonus)VibeGuard was developed using an AI-native "Vibe Coding" workflow:Logic Prototyping: Used Google AI Studio to engineer the "Strict Arbiter" persona, ensuring the AI could distinguish between high-effort work and "AI-slop."Visual Identity: The Royal Blue & Coral colour palette was generated via AI collaboration to balance financial trust with community energy.Autonomous Decision Making: The system uses a JSON-enforced response format to ensure the blockchain logic never encounters "chatty" or ambiguous AI outputs.“I used AI Studio to bridge the gap between human language and on-chain execution in under 2 hours.”🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.9+Google AI Studio API KeyInstallationClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VibeGuard.git
