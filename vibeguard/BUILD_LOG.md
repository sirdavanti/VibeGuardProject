# 🤖 VibeGuard | AI Build Log

This log documents the collaborative development of VibeGuard between the developer and **Gemini 3 Flash**.

## 🗓️ Timeline: Feb 17 - Feb 18, 2026
* **Project Start:** Attempted to bridge Solana-based escrow logic to BNB Chain.
* **The Pivot:** Gemini identified the "anti-bot" requirements of BNB Chain and helped refactor the smart contract for the BSC ecosystem.
* **Brain Surgery:** Implemented a Node.js AI Agent that uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to perform qualitative audits.
* **The Handshake:** Integrated Ethers.js v6 to bridge the AI's cryptographic signature to the `releaseFunds` function in Solidity.

## 🛠️ AI Pair-Programming Highlights
* **Solidity Refactoring:** Gemini assisted in implementing `ECDSA` and `MessageHashUtils` from OpenZeppelin to ensure secure signature recovery.
* **UI/UX Refinement:** Used AI-driven design principles to implement a "Royal Blue & Coral" professional aesthetic.
* **Troubleshooting:** Gemini diagnosed a "white screen" error caused by double-nested ABI arrays and provided the fix in seconds.

## 🏁 Result
A fully autonomous, on-chain arbiter built, tested, and deployed to the BNB Testnet in under 48 hours.
